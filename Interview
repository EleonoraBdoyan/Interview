# ToDo List
# Write a task organizing program.
# The aim of the program is to provide a console interface, with the help of which the user can see his/her daily
# tasks. Each task should be only one sentence.
# The user should be able to add tasks, see all the tasks, mark if the task is done or not and remove the task from
# the list if necessary.
# For the actions (mentioned above) to be performed the program should provide a list of commands that correspond to
# those actions.
# The tasks should be kept in a separate text file, so that they are not lost when the user closes the program.

 # The digital root of a number n is obtained as follows: Add up the digits n to get a new number.
# Add up the digits of that to get another new number. Keep doing this until you get a number that has
# only one digit. That number is the digital root. For example, if n = 45893, we add up the digits to get
# 4 + 5 + 8 + 9 + 3 = 29. We then add up the digits of 29 target 2+9=11.
# We then add up the digits of 11toget 1+1=2. Since 2 has only one digit, 2 is our digital root.
