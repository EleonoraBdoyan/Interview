# ToDo List
# Write a task organizing program.
# The aim of the program is to provide a console interface, with the help of which the user can see his/her daily
# tasks. Each task should be only one sentence.
# The user should be able to add tasks, see all the tasks, mark if the task is done or not and remove the task from
# the list if necessary.
# For the actions (mentioned above) to be performed the program should provide a list of commands that correspond to
# those actions.
# The tasks should be kept in a separate text file, so that they are not lost when the user closes the program.

# The Library Management System is a program that allows users to manage a library collection of books.
# The system provides the following functionalities:
# Add Books: The user is allowed to enter the full name of the author, the name of the book and its publication date
# . The list of all the books should be kept in a text file.
# Remove Books: The user is allowed to remove a book from the list by using its name.
# View All Books: The user can see the list of all the books in the library.
# Sort Books Alphabetically: The user can make the sorted list of all the books in the library.
# The system should store the library's book collection in a text file. When the program starts,
# it should read the file and load the books into memory. When the user makes changes to the library,
# such as adding or removing a book, the program should update the file accordingly. To implement this
# system, you can use Python's built-in file handling capabilities to read and write to the file that stores
# the library collection. You can also use Python's data structures like lists and dictionaries to store the
# book collection in memory and provide the necessary functionalities like sorting and removing books.
