# ToDo List
# Write a task organizing program.
# The aim of the program is to provide a console interface, with the help of which the user can see his/her daily
# tasks. Each task should be only one sentence.
# The user should be able to add tasks, see all the tasks, mark if the task is done or not and remove the task from
# the list if necessary.
# For the actions (mentioned above) to be performed the program should provide a list of commands that correspond to
# those actions.
# The tasks should be kept in a separate text file, so that they are not lost when the user closes the program.
